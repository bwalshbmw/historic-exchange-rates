# Historical Exchange Rates

This project is used to show how the exchange rates of certain currencies have changed over time. The initial implementation will compart Real Brazilian Dollars (BRL) against Euros (EUR), the US Dollar (USD), and the Australian Dollar (AUD). Future versions may be expanded to allow for different currencies to be substituted in instead.

To see the projects planning, please visit the [Projects](https://github.com/bwalshbmw/historic-exchange-rates/projects) of this repo to see how units of work were broken up during the scoping phase.

Data provided by the [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) and the graph was generated using [Chartkick](https://github.com/ankane/chartkick).
